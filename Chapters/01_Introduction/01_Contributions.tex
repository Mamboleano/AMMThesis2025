\section{Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formal Modeling: We develop a formal model of AMMs that integrates trading fees, capturing their effect on swap outcomes and user's incentives. 
    \item Economic Analysis: We provide formal proofs analyzing core economic properties of AMMs incorporated with fees, such as how they impact user's gain on token swaps, arbitrage opportunities and exchange rates. 
    \item Lean 4 Formalization: The major contribuiton of this work. We provide a complete formalization of all the new definitions, lemmas and theorems introduced in this thesis, as well as their formal proof. This ensures mathematical rigor and serves as a formal verification on all the properties presented.  
\end{enumerate}

Providing a formal verification on the role of trading fees in AMMs, this thesis contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the robustness and security of DeFi systems.
