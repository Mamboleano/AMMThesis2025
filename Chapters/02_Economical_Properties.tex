\chapter{Economic properties of AMMs with trading fees}

In this chapter we study the economic properties of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) that apply a trading fee on swap transactions. Our goal is to analyze how trading fees play a role on the incentives of users and the behavior and properties of swap functions, with keen focus on the constant product swap rate function (~\ref{defi:const-prod}).

All the results of this paper are formalized in Lean 4 and are based on an extension of the model introduced by Bartoletti et al. in \cite{BCL22lmcs}, and the formalization in Lean 4 introduced by Pusceddu et al. in \cite{PB24arxiv}.

To help the reader understand better the importance of each lemma and result, we introduce the economic intuition behind the results, their formal statement, and - when appropriate - an illustrative example.
